FUNCTIONS

==== built in functions ====

na.rm=False is a common default(hidden) argument in R functions.
na == not available/no value/nan/null
rm == remove

so na.rm=False means to include null values in the calculation.... which will probably make it fail

~~some stuff repeated from python about arg positioning  ~~~~  

putting in 1 instead of TRUE works (for sd() at least)

-- is the primary arg value for most default functions x?
this code ran just fine:
sd(TRUE, x=c(4,2,3,5,6,1,1))

## Check the expected/default args of a function with this function:
args(>name to check<)

========

By default, R treats the last line of code in a function as "return", same as the last line in a notebook cell. 
If you're going to explicitly call return, it's a function of its own

IF ---- acts like a function

Even if the final line of code is happening inside an if/else block, it still counts as the last and returns by default

range takes in a vector and specifies the distance between the low and high numbers
