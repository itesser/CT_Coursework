AirBnB NY Locations Data Case Study\n","\n","The biggest additional layer I added to the data was Host Status. \n","\n","(Well, it resides in a bigger structure of the dataframe unique_hosts, which also holds summary statistics such as total reviews per month and average price)\n","\n"," When sorting through the columns of bnb_data to see what would be dropped or modified when added to unique_hosts, there was time to evaluate the \"last_review\" column. \n"," \n"," Last review was used to categorize hosts into \"Active\" (review in 2019 = True), \"Inactive\" (review prior to 2019 = True), and \"No Review\". \n"," \n"," [If I hadn't already hard-coded answers below based on this, I'd go back and change the 'Active' status to represent hosts that have received reviews in the past 12 months, rather than just the last 6, but I didn't fully realize that the review data cut off in july of 2019 until after answering question #10]\n","\n","\n","Where relevant, I have included additional calculations pulled from only listings belonging to active hosts.\n","\n","\n","1. Which hosts are the busiest and why?\n","\n","\"Busyness\" refers to a state of mind, which can't be resolved just by looking at numbers. However, we can look at numbers that may impact a host's feeling of busy-ness:\n","- Total quantity of reviews\n","- average number of reviews per month (frequent turnover, also to be viewed in context of host's total properties)\n","\n","ergo:\n","+ Sonder(NYC) has both a large number of properties and a lot of reviews per month, but also high average availability, potentially pointing to low occupancy.\n","\n","+ Danielle (host ID: 26432133) has a handful of listings, but an average of 13 reviews per month *per listing*. This points to each unit being filled at least 13 nights per month, despite having a calculated mean availability over 280. \n","+ + Calculations up to this point have been done on the dataset of active hosts with at least 5 properties. If the threshold is lowered to 3 properties per host, Nalicia (host id:156684502) has a higher rate of reviews per listing per month (18.13), and it may be a matter of personal opinion whether Danielle or Nalicia is feels more busy.\n","\n","2. How many neighborhood groups are available and which shows up the most?\n","\n","- Manhattan has the most listings overall (21.7k) and also the most active listings (12.4k).\n","\n","+ Despite the high number of rooms availalbe, Manhattan has the second highest rate of blackout nights (an average of 169 blackout nights per year), \n","+ + Staten Island listings only have an average of 116 blackout nights per year.\n","+ + (Brooklyn listings have the highest average blackout dates per year at 191)\n","\n","3. Are private rooms the most popular in Manhattan? \n","\n","- Among active listings, the most popular type of housing in Manhattan is 'Entire home/apt' \n","\n","+ + Brooklyn's top listing type is alos 'Entire home/apt, \n","+ + Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island, private rooms are most popular.\n","\n","4. Which hosts are the busiest and based on their reviews?\n","(revisted #1 and tweaked its code to get these numbers)\n","\n","- Louann (host id: 228415932) only has one property listed on AirBnB, but has a whopping 20.9 reviews per month. \n","+ + Nalicia (host id: 156684502) is not too far behind with 18.1 reviews per month per property.\n","\n","5. Which neighorhood group has the highest average price?\n","\n","- Manhattan, by a country mile.\n","- - Manhattan: 196.88\n","- - Brooklyn: 124.38\n","\n","+ Evaluating only active hosts:\n","+ + Manhattan: 190.45 \n","+ + Brooklyn down to 123.97\n","\n","6.  Which neighbor hood group has the highest total price?\n","\n","...Manhattan? (based on knowing from previous questions that it has the highest average price (#5) and that it shows up the most (#2))\n","\n","- Doing new math: if all listed Manhattan homes (regardless of availability) were filled on the same night, the collective guests would spend $4.26 million for the privilege.\n","\n","+ + Limiting this calculation to active hosts would drop the aggregate price to a mere $2.36 million for one night of accomodation.\n","\n","- Multiplying the price of each listing (held by active hosts) by the number of nights that listing is available reveals the listing's theoretical annual value.\n","- -  All together, Manhattan's listings by active hosts have a theoretical annual value of $411 million, which accounts for 58% of the earning potential of AirBnB accomodations in New York.\n","\n","7. Which top 5 hosts have the highest total price?\n","\n","The 5 hosts with the top per-night earning potential are:\n","- Sonder (NYC)  (id: 219517861)    \n","- -  $82,795\n","- Blueground    (id: 107434423)    \n","- - $70,331\n","- Sally         (id: 156158778)     \n","- - $37,097\n","- Red Awning    (id: 205031545)    \n","- - $35,294\n","- Kara          (id: 30283594)      \n","- - $33,581\n","\n","8. Who currently has no (zero) availability with a review count of 100 or more?\n","\n","- There are currently 162 listings with over 100 reviews that have no availability at this time.\n","\n","+ 112 of them are overseen by hosts that have received reviews (for any property) in 2019 \n","+ 50 listings with 0 availability are overseen by hosts that have not received any reviews in 2019.\n","+ + Eighteen of these formerly-popular listings have not been stayed in since 2017 (at the latest)\n","+ + 19 more were stayed in as recently as July 2019 \n","+ + + (including the most popular listing in this group, which has 480 reviews.)\n","\n","9.
