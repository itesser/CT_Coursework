4 filtered values
posterized (https://github.com/fjean/pymeanshift)
- top 6 colors

after each image manipulation, the pixel values can be sorted into a 1-D array for numeric processing. 

order of operations:
0) linearize
1) partition.
2) split to normal/posterized
Normal:
3) convert to HSL
4) get center pixel {1}
5) reshape to 1D array
6) count values, name top 3 {3}
7) re-reshape to 2D, each row being a pixel, the three columns being H/S/L.
8) Average each H/S/L {3}
9) Brightest pixel (and count) {2}
10) least bright pixel (and count) {2}
11) brightness distribution (quartiles, % above 85, % below 15) {7}
12) saturation distribution {5}
13) % with saturation above 70 AND lightness between 20 and 80 {1}
14) hue distribution within above subset (% of overall pixels) {6}
14) hue distribution by banding {6}

posterized:
15) Convert to HSL
16) reshape to 1D
17) top 4 colors, and their percentage of total. {8}
