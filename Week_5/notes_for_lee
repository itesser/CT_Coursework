Setting up dvd_sales_data (from class notes) PG Admin
- importing data
- might be fine if it fails, refresh the server and tables  will probably pop up
- lots of troubleshooting at this point
- if you can see the time on anyone's screen, go forward to 33 past the hour

Right Click on "postgres" to get auto-generated ERD for database
Right Schema -> Open query tool
F5 to run queries

+ Built in scratch pad! (I love this feature)
+ Dark mode exists and isn't super dark

- concat function -> naked concat first_name || ' ' || last_name  
- aliasing (though pg admin doesn't like using aliases as variables later in the function)
- where clause
- not equal operand (<>) (!= also works)
- LIKE and % <-- infinite wildcard
- briefly touch on LOWER()
- _ <-- literal wildcard
- BETWEEN + AND
- ORDER BY (ASC/DESC)
- DISTINCT
- Group By
- JOINS
-- Inner, Left, Right
-- FULL - -- Joining 4 different tables to see info on customers in Angola/Brazil

Alex taught:
SELECT rental.rental_date, rental.rental_id, rental.staff_id, language.name, film.title
FROM rental
FULL JOIN inventory
ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
FULL JOIN film
ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
FULL JOIN language
ON language.language_id = film.language_id
WHERE language.name = 'English'


Randall prefers:
SELECT  rental_date, rental_id, staff_id, title, l.name
FROM rental r, inventory i, film, language l
WHERE r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
AND i.film_id = film.film_id
AND film.language_id = l.language_id
AND l.name = 'English'
